                <h1>Frequently Asked Questions and Common Issues</h1>
                <h2>User Verification Issues</h2>
                <p>Somtimes a user will report that they are having issues verifying themselves. This is nearly always caused by a small user error, so please ask them to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure that they are logged in to the correct Discord account in their <strong>browser</strong>.</li>
                    <li>If they are using the <em>profile code</em> verification method, ensure the code isn't being filtered by Roblox's chat filter. If it is, try using the in-game verification method instead. If it isn't, make sure they went back to the website and clicked "Done".</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Verification</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can change your verified account (or update your username) at any time, just follow the verification process again.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The bot is constantly adding and taking away roles from users!</strong> &mdash; Most likely cause is that you've bound the verification role to a group as well. Bind the group rank to a different Discord role.</li>
                    <li><strong>How do I turn off the announcement channel?</strong> &mdash; Run the AnnounceChannel command without any arguments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Can I change role names after they are set up in Rover?</strong> &mdash; Yes, roles are saved by id, not name.</li>
                    <li><strong>Can I be verified as different users in different servers?</strong> &mdash; No, verifications are global across all servers, even if they are self-hosted.</li>
                </ul>
