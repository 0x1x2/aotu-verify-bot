# What is it?

RoVer is an open source, drop-in verification bot that will allow your members to safely authenticate their Roblox account on your Discord server. This empowers your Roblox community with the following advantages:

- Speak with confidence, because everyone is who their name says they are.
- Adding an extra step between trolls & spammers and your server will reduce unwanted activity drastically.
- The verification database is already populated with thousands of Discord-Roblox account links, so it's possible users will already be verified when they join your server.
- The hosted version of RoVer does not have any API rate limiting and will automatically be able to update roles the second the user verifies. (If you host RoVer yourself, the user will have to run a command in order for the verification to take place.)

# How does it work?

RoVer uses the same verification system used by the [ROBLOX Discord](https://discord.gg/roblox) server, a web app that lives at [verify.eryn.io](https://verify.eryn.io). RoVer makes use of its [public API](https://verify.eryn.io/api).

## Step 1

The user signs in with their Discord account.

## Step 2

The user chooses how they want to verify: by joining a ROBLOX game, or by adding a code to their profile.

# Getting Started with RoVer

The quickest and easiest way to use RoVer is to [add the hosted version](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=298796807323123712&scope=bot&permissions=402656264) to your server.

You can also clone this repository and host it yourself and make any modifications you wish.
